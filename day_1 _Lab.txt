 Q 14 Check if a given number is leap year or not 

  Leap Year contains 366 days, which comes once every four years. Every leap year corresponds to these facts : 

  A century year is a year ending with 00. A century year is a leap year only if it is divisible by 400.
  A leap year (except a century year) can be identified if it is exactly divisible by 4.
  A century year should be divisible by 4 and 100 both.
  A non-century year should be divisible only by 4.

Q 15 wap to calculate simple interest Simple Interest = (P x T x R)/100
 Where,
  P is the principle amount
  T is the time and
  R is the rate


suppose 
  EXAMPLE1:-
  Input : P = 10000
          R = 5
          T = 5
  Output : 2500

  We need to find simple interest on Rs. 10, 000 at the rate of 5% for 5 units of time.

EXAMPLE2:
  Input : P = 3000
        R = 7
        T = 1
  Output :210
